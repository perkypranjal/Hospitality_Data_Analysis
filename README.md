Atliq owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

## Key Metrics :
Key metrics and measures are crucial for measuring performance and making informed decisions.

Most important ones used in this project are given below :
- 📌 RevPAR(Revenue generated per available room(both booked and non booked))
- 📌Occupancy means how many rooms are occupied among all the available rooms.
- 📌ADR(Average Daily Rate) is the measure of average paid for rooms sold in a given time, it also tells how pricing of a hotel room is
- 📌DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights) This metrics tells us on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day
- 📌DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights) This metric tells us how many rooms are booked per night . Also includes cancellation & no show measures
- 📌Cancellation means the customers who cancelled their bookings and got a refund of 40%
- 📌No Show means the customers who neither cancelled their bookings nor showed up
- 📌DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights) This metric tells us how many rooms are utilized per night
- 📌Realization tells about how many rooms were actually utilized among booked rooms and many more.
- 📌Flat Pricing means following the same rates for 365 days
- 📌Weekday/Weekend Pricing means having different rates for weekdays & weekends
- 📌Dynamic Pricing means having different rates for weekdays & peak days

## Learnt things from this Project : 
- By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
- Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. 
- Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard.

## Some Important insights from the Dashboard :

- Mumbai generates the highest revenue (669 M) followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi
- AtliQ Exotica performs better compared to all 7 type of properties with 320 Million revenue, rating 3.62, occupancy percentage 57 and cancellation rate as 24.4%.
